# CI-and-unit-test-on-python  

Is my teach project, oriented on learning GitHub Actions and work with CI in GitHub.
  
## Simple math programm on Python  
Running the programm with the following command:  

```python3 main.py```  

main.py contains the ```class Calculator```, which can do simple ariphmectics operations, and the ```def array_sum```, which finds the sum of the numbers in an array

## Unit Testing with Python

Running the unit tests with the following command:

```python3 test.py```

test.py imports the generated calculator and unittest module needed to set up and run tests, as well as the array_sum function.
